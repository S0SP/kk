# MongoDB Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented MongoDB integration for the KiraanaKloud application with the following features:

1. **Invoice Data Storage**: Store invoice data extracted from Gemini AI into MongoDB
2. **Barcode Management**: Create and manage unique barcodes for products
3. **Inventory Tracking**: Real-time inventory updates with barcode scanning
4. **Product Management**: Complete product lifecycle management

## Database Schema

### Collections

#### 1. `invoices` Collection
Stores invoice data extracted from Gemini AI analysis:
```javascript
{
  items: [
    {
      name: string,
      quantity: number,
      price: number,
      total: number
    }
  ],
  totalAmount: number,
  invoiceDate?: string,
  vendorName?: string,
  invoiceNumber?: string,
  createdAt: Date,
  imageUrl?: string
}
```

#### 2. `barcodes` Collection
Stores product barcode information:
```javascript
{
  name: string,
  barcode: string,
  imageUrl: string,
  productId: ObjectId,
  createdAt: Date
}
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. `/api/invoices` (POST)
- **Purpose**: Store invoice data from Gemini AI analysis
- **Input**: Invoice data with items, amounts, vendor info
- **Output**: Success response with generated barcodes
- **Features**:
  - Validates invoice data
  - Generates unique barcodes for new products
  - Links products to barcode collection
  - Handles duplicate product names

### 2. `/api/barcode` (POST)
- **Purpose**: Look up product by barcode
- **Input**: Barcode string
- **Output**: Product information with current stock
- **Features**:
  - Finds product by barcode
  - Returns current stock from latest invoice
  - Includes product image and pricing

### 3. `/api/barcode` (PUT)
- **Purpose**: Update product quantity (sell/restock)
- **Input**: Barcode and action ('sell' or 'restock')
- **Output**: Updated product information
- **Features**:
  - Decreases quantity by 1 for 'sell' action
  - Increases quantity by 1 for 'restock' action
  - Creates new invoice entry with updated quantities
  - Maintains audit trail

### 4. `/api/barcode` (GET)
- **Purpose**: Get all products with current stock levels
- **Output**: Array of products with quantities and prices
- **Features**:
  - Returns all barcode entries
  - Calculates current stock from latest invoices
  - Includes product images and pricing

## Frontend Integration

### 1. New Stock Upload (`new-stock.tsx`)
- **Enhanced**: Now stores invoice data in MongoDB via API
- **Features**:
  - Sends analyzed invoice data to `/api/invoices`
  - Receives generated barcodes for products
  - Handles errors gracefully
  - Shows loading states during API calls

### 2. Inventory Sync (`inventory-sync.tsx`)
- **Enhanced**: Real-time barcode scanning with MongoDB
- **Features**:
  - Scans barcodes and looks up products in MongoDB
  - Updates stock quantities in real-time
  - Shows product images and details
  - Handles sell/restock operations
  - Displays current inventory from database

### 3. Products Page (`products.tsx`)
- **Enhanced**: Loads products from MongoDB
- **Features**:
  - Fetches products from `/api/barcode`
  - Combines with new stock products
  - Shows real-time inventory levels
  - Fallback to mock data if MongoDB fails

## Technical Implementation

### 1. MongoDB Connection (`src/lib/mongodb.ts`)
- Connection pooling with caching
- Environment-based configuration
- Error handling and reconnection logic

### 2. Error Handling
- JSON parsing validation
- Database connection error handling
- Graceful fallbacks for frontend
- Comprehensive error logging

### 3. Data Flow
```
Invoice Image â†’ Gemini AI â†’ Invoice Data â†’ MongoDB â†’ Barcode Generation â†’ Product Management
```

## Testing Results

âœ… **MongoDB Connection**: Successfully connected to MongoDB Atlas
âœ… **Invoice Storage**: Successfully stores invoice data with generated barcodes
âœ… **Barcode Lookup**: Successfully retrieves products by barcode
âœ… **Stock Updates**: Successfully updates quantities (sell/restock)
âœ… **Product Listing**: Successfully lists all products with current stock

## Database Connection Details
- **URI**: `mongodb+srv://sumitchourasia63:lvPmW0TvP5XxqAos@cluster0.o4znxej.mongodb.net/`
- **Database**: `kiraanakloud`
- **Collections**: `invoices`, `barcodes`

## Security Features
- Input validation for all API endpoints
- JSON parsing error handling
- Database connection error handling
- Graceful error responses

## Performance Optimizations
- Connection pooling for MongoDB
- Cached database connections
- Efficient queries with proper indexing
- Minimal data transfer

## Next Steps
1. Add authentication and authorization
2. Implement data backup and recovery
3. Add analytics and reporting features
4. Optimize database queries for large datasets
5. Add real-time notifications for low stock

## Files Modified/Created
- `src/lib/mongodb.ts` - MongoDB connection service
- `src/app/api/invoices/route.ts` - Invoice storage API
- `src/app/api/barcode/route.ts` - Barcode management API
- `src/app/api/test-mongodb/route.ts` - Connection test API
- `src/components/shopkeeper/new-stock.tsx` - Enhanced with MongoDB
- `src/components/shopkeeper/inventory-sync.tsx` - Enhanced with MongoDB
